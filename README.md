## Purpose of the App

In today's fast-paced world, it's easy to get caught up in daily routines and forget to prioritize mental health. Buddy aims to provide a one-stop solution for users to improve their mental well-being by integrating self-care practices, acts of kindness, and journaling into their daily lives.

## Features

### To-Do List
The To-Do List feature encourages users to perform small acts of kindness throughout the day. Buddy generates a list of three random tasks for users to complete, such as smiling at a stranger or complimenting a friend. Users can mark off tasks as they complete them, promoting a sense of accomplishment and positive reinforcement.

### Daily Care
The Daily Care section is a compilation of randomly generated affirmations, quotes, jokes, advice, and fun facts designed to uplift and inspire users. By providing a variety of content, Buddy ensures that users have access to a diverse range of positive messages and helpful tips that can be applied to their daily lives.

### Journaling
The Journaling feature enables users to express their thoughts and emotions through daily entries. By clicking on the journal button in the home page, users can access a separate page where they can create and save daily entries that asks what they are grateful for and what they need to let go of. This promotes self-reflection and emotional awareness, ultimately fostering personal growth.
